        Parameters:
            value: Value to show in Markdown component. If callable, the function will be called whenever the app loads to set the initial value of the component.
            label: The label for this component. Is used as the header if there are a table of examples for this component. If None and used in a `gr.Interface`, the label will be the name of the parameter this component is assigned to.
            every: Continously calls `value` to recalculate it if `value` is a function (has no effect otherwise). Can provide a Timer whose tick resets `value`, or a float that provides the regular interval for the reset Timer.
            inputs: Components that are used as inputs to calculate `value` if `value` is a function (has no effect otherwise). `value` is recalculated any time the inputs change.
            show_label: This parameter has no effect.
            rtl: If True, sets the direction of the rendered text to right-to-left. Default is False, which renders text left-to-right.
            latex_delimiters: A list of dicts of the form {"left": open delimiter (str), "right": close delimiter (str), "display": whether to display in newline (bool)} that will be used to render LaTeX expressions. If not provided, `latex_delimiters` is set to `[{ "left": "$$", "right": "$$", "display": True }]`, so only expressions enclosed in $$ delimiters will be rendered as LaTeX, and in a new line. Pass in an empty list to disable LaTeX rendering. For more information, see the [KaTeX documentation](https://katex.org/docs/autorender.html).
            visible: If False, component will be hidden.
            elem_id: An optional string that is assigned as the id of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.
            elem_classes: An optional list of strings that are assigned as the classes of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.
            render: If False, component will not render be rendered in the Blocks context. Should be used if the intention is to assign event listeners now but render the component later.
            key: if assigned, will be used to assume identity across a re-render. Components that have the same key across a re-render will have their value preserved.
            sanitize_html: If False, will disable HTML sanitization when converted from markdown. This is not recommended, as it can lead to security vulnerabilities.
            line_breaks: If True, will enable Github-flavored Markdown line breaks in chatbot messages. If False (default), single new lines will be ignored.
            header_links: If True, will automatically create anchors for headings, displaying a link icon on hover.
            height: An optional maximum height of this component, specified in pixels if a number is passed, or in CSS units (e.g., '200px') if a stirng is passed in. If context exceeds this height, a scrollbar is added.
